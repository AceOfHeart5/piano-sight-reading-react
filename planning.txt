Moving this app over to react/redux is not as drag and drop as I thought it'd be. Further more I'm pretty sure there's some crappy logic in the old design that I'd like to improve. So it's time to bust out a txt file to help organize thoughts and plan things out.

Let's start by describing how the old app worked as best we can. The key part is that the "music" is an array of chord objects, which store midi values for notes. The number of entries in the array is equal to the greatest number of notes per measure between the staffs (top and bottom) times the number of measures. So for example if there were 9 measures and the bottom staff was quarters notes and the top staff half notes, then the total number of entries in the array would be 36 (9 measures x 4 notes per measure bottom staff). A cursor keeps track of which index in the array the user is playing. Using navigator.requestMidiAccess, we can setup callbacks when the user plays a midi device. If a midi event contains the same values as the chord at the current index, then the cursor advances.

In addition to re-writing the above logic, we have to create random music generation in a logical way. We have to render the music to the DOM using abcjs, which requires a special string. Here's an example of a string generated by the old system:

T:
M:4/4
L:1/48
K:C
%%staves {1 2}
V:1
[K:C clef=treble]
[CC']12 D'12 D12 A12 |F'12 F'12 D12 F'12 |G12 F12 C'12 C'12 |F'12 G'12 C'12 G'12 |

The above is ABC notation. We'll have to explore this site more later to make sure we understand what we're doing: https://abcnotation.com/

The main takeaway here is that we have to understand which notes are in the top staff, and which are in the bottom, in order to generate the above notation. So we can't simply generate the array we described above then derive the notation from that.

Unless perhaps we modify our chord object to keep track of which midi values are in the top staff, and which are in the bottom? This could work because we keep track of what duration the top/bottom staff notes should be in global state. We could simply grab all top/bottom staff notes from the array, then add notes to the generate string above with the currect duration.

However now I'm thinking about how precise this system should be. Does it make sense to create a data set that could represent any piece of music, even those without consistent durations? I like that idea because it lets us more easily expand this app in the future. Maybe users could create custom pieces of music to play through?

The first thing that throws me off about doing that is keeping track of when key or time signature changes. Our system would have to go measure by measure, and each measure would need its own time signature, key signature, set of bottom notes, and set of top notes. Additionally each note would have to keep track of its own duration. Now that I've described it to myself, I'm not against doing this because it sounds manageable. And I like the idea of our custom data containing so much information about the music by itself. I can imagine making a system that randomly generates this data, or allowing the user to create their own custom data.

Then, given this, I saw we proceed with making this custom music data, a way to track it in state, and a system of rendering it with abcjs. We could easily create dummy data that's just a bunch of quarter notes of the same note. Later we'll worry about creating logic to randomly generate it.

Quick note, I don't think using the entity adapter makes sense for most of this app. We don't have lot's of pieces of data that will be individuall updated, added, or removed.
